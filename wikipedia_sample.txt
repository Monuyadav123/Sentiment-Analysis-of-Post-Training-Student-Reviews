Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence 
displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of intelligent agents: any 
system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. 
Some popular accounts use the term "artificial intelligence" to describe machines that mimic cognitive 
functions such as learning and problem solving.
