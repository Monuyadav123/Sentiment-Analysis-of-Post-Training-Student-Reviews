# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Post-Training-Student-Reviews
Student Reviews Sentiment Analysis and Next-Word Prediction using LSTM

This repository contains two related projects:

Sentiment Analysis of Student Reviews

Built and compared traditional machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, SVM) and deep learning models (LSTM, Transformers) to classify post-training student reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

Generated insights from student feedback that can be used to improve training quality and learner satisfaction.

Next-Word Prediction using LSTM

Implemented an LSTM-based model trained on a sample Wikipedia corpus (about 50,000 tokens) for predictive text generation.

Applied tokenization and sequence padding, with the model achieving around 60% accuracy after 10 epochs.

Demonstrates fundamental natural language processing techniques such as embeddings and sequential modeling.

The repository includes:

data/ — synthetic student review dataset and Wikipedia text sample

src/ — Python scripts for preprocessing, sentiment classification, and next-word prediction

notebooks/ — Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and training

requirements.txt — list of dependencies for environment setup

README.md — detailed project overview and instructions

This project is intended as a practical demonstration of natural language processing workflows, combining both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. It is suitable for learning, experimentation, and showcasing skills in text analytics and language modeling.
